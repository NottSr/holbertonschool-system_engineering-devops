<h2>Background Context</h2>

<p>When I was working for SlideShare, I worked on an auto-remediation tool called <a href="/rltoken/ftFvBjxNPLoWcF9eHaK8yw" title="Skynet" target="_blank">Skynet</a> that monitored, scaled and fixed Cloud infrastructure. I was using a parallel job-execution system called MCollective that allowed me to execute commands to one or multiple servers at the same time. I could apply an action to a selected set of servers by applying a filter such as the server’s hostname or any other metadata we had (server type, server environment…). At some point, a bug was present in my code that sent <code>nil</code> to the filter method. </p>

<p>There were 2 pieces of bad news:</p>

<ol>
<li>When MCollective receives <code>nil</code> as an argument for its filter method, it takes this to mean ‘all servers’</li>
<li>The action I sent was to terminate the selected servers</li>
</ol>

<p>I started the parallel job-execution and after some time, I realized that it was taking longer than expected. Looking at logs I realized that I was shutting down SlideShare’s entire document conversion environment. Actually, 75% of all our conversion infrastructure servers had been shut down, resulting in users not able to convert their PDFs, powerpoints, and videos… Pretty bad!</p>

<p>Thanks to Puppet, we were able to restore our infrastructure to normal operation in under 1H, pretty impressive. Imagine if we had to do everything manually: launching the servers, configuring and linking them, importing application code, starting every process, and obviously, fixing all the bugs (you should know by now that complicated infrastructure always goes sideways)…</p>

<p>Obviously writing Puppet code for your infrastructure requires an investment of time and energy, but in the long term, it is for sure a must-have.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS</li>
<li>All your files should end with a new line</li>
<li>A <code>README.md</code> file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory</li>
<li>Your Puppet manifests must pass <code>puppet-lint</code> version 2.1.1 without any errors</li>
<li>Your Puppet manifests must run without error</li>
<li>Your Puppet manifests first line must be a comment explaining what the Puppet manifest is about</li>
<li>Your Puppet manifests files must end with the extension <code>.pp</code> </li>
</ul>

<h2>Note on Versioning</h2>

<p>Your Ubuntu 20.04 VM should have Puppet 5.5 preinstalled. </p>

<h3>Install <code>puppet</code></h3>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install -y ruby=1:2.7+1 --allow-downgrades
$ apt-get install -y ruby-augeas
$ apt-get install -y ruby-shadow
$ apt-get install -y puppet
</code></pre>

<p>You do <strong>not</strong> need to attempt to upgrade versions. This project is simply a set of tasks to familiarize you with the basic level syntax which is virtually identical in newer versions of Puppet. </p>
